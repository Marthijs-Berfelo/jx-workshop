# jx-workshop
An introduction to Jenkins-X and the underlying visualizations

## Preparations
During the workshop theory will be supported by hands-on tasks to explore the tools. To make sure we can all get the most out of the workshop, these tools should be installed beforehand. The following 2 pages provide information and links to the installation guides: 

[install docker](install-docker.md)

[install kubernetes](install-kubernetes.md)
